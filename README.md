## GPT - Agents


This project implements a Company Agent designed to interface with Marketo tool documentation for automating tasks and providing insights based on the documentation. The project includes two distinct agent implementations:

 - **Agent 1:  Azure OpenAI Service (GPT-3.5 Turbo Model)** (main.py)

This agent is built using the Azure OpenAI Service and leverages the GPT-3.5 Turbo model for natural language understanding and generation. It is tailored to interpret and respond to queries regarding Marketo documentation, offering automated support for various use cases within the company.

- **Agent 2: Langchain-Based Agent with OpenAI API and Pinecone Vector Database** (main_dev.py)

The second agent is developed using the Langchain library and integrates the OpenAI API for language processing. Additionally, it uses the Pinecone Vector Database for managing and querying vectorized data, which enables fast and efficient retrieval of information from the Marketo documentation.

Each agent is built to provide flexible and scalable solutions for enhancing productivity through automated interactions with Marketo's resources, tailored to different infrastructure and technology preferences.
